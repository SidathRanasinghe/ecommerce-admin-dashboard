---

Based on your code files, I now have a clear understanding of your project. Let me break down everything for you:

## What This Project Is

This is a **multi-tenant e-commerce admin dashboard** built with Next.js 13+ (App Router). It's designed to manage multiple online stores from a single dashboard. Here's what it provides:

### Key Features:

- **Order management**: Track sales, revenue, and order history
- **Dashboard analytics**: Revenue charts, sales counts, stock levels
- **User authentication**: Secure login/signup with Clerk
- **Image uploads**: Cloudinary integration for product images
- **Payment processing**: Stripe integration for handling payments
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM

### Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Server Actions
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide React icons

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites:

1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
3. Accounts for: Clerk, Cloudinary, Stripe

### Setup Steps:

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd ecommerce-dashboard
npm install
```

2. **Environment setup:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in all the required environment variables:
     - **Clerk**: Create account at clerk.com, get API keys
     - **MongoDB**: Set up MongoDB Atlas, get connection string
     - **Cloudinary**: Create account, get cloud name
     - **Stripe**: Create account, get API keys and webhook secret
     - **Store URL**: Your frontend store URL (if you have a separate customer-facing store)

3. **Database setup:**

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. **Run development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the app:**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Sign up/login to create your first store

## Deployment Options

### ❌ GitHub Pages - NOT POSSIBLE

GitHub Pages only supports static sites. Your app requires:

- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- Database connections
- Authentication middleware

### ✅ Recommended Deployment Platforms:

1. **Vercel** (Best option for Next.js):

   - Free tier available
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Built-in support for Next.js
   - Easy environment variable management

2. **Netlify**:

   - Good Next.js support
   - Free tier available

3. **Railway**:

   - Full-stack deployment
   - Database hosting included

4. **Render**:
   - Free tier available
   - Good for full-stack apps

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

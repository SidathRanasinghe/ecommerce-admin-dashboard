# Multi Tenant E-Commerce Admin Dashboard

---

Based on your code files, I now have a clear understanding of your project. Let
me break down everything for you:

## What This Project Is

This is a **multi-tenant e-commerce admin dashboard** built with Next.js 13+
(App Router). It's designed to manage multiple online stores from a single
dashboard. Here's what it provides:

### Key Features:

- **Multi-store management**: One user can manage multiple stores
- **Product management**: Create, edit, delete products with images, categories,
  and sizes
- **Order management**: Track sales, revenue, and order history
- **Dashboard analytics**: Revenue charts, sales counts, stock levels
- **User authentication**: Secure login/signup with Clerk
- **Image uploads**: Cloudinary integration for product images
- **Payment processing**: Stripe integration for handling payments
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM

### Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Server Actions
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide React icons

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites:

1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
3. Accounts for: Clerk, Cloudinary, Stripe

### Setup Steps:

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd ecommerce-dashboard
npm install
```

2. **Environment setup:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in all the required environment variables:
     - **Clerk**: Create account at clerk.com, get API keys
     - **MongoDB**: Set up MongoDB Atlas, get connection string
     - **Cloudinary**: Create account, get cloud name

     - **Store URL**: Your frontend store URL (if you have a separate
       customer-facing store)

3. **Database setup:**

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. **Run development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the app:**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Sign up/login to create your first store

## Deployment Options

### ❌ GitHub Pages - NOT POSSIBLE

GitHub Pages only supports static sites. Your app requires:

- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- Database connections
- Authentication middleware

### ✅ Recommended Deployment Platforms:

1. **Vercel** (Best option for Next.js):
   - Free tier available
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Built-in support for Next.js
   - Easy environment variable management

2. **Netlify**:
   - Good Next.js support
   - Free tier available

3. **Railway**:
   - Full-stack deployment
   - Database hosting included

4. **Render**:
